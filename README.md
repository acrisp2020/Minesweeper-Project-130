# Minesweeper-Project-130

## Key Features and Requirements

1. **Overview of Minesweeper:**
   - Minesweeper is a classic logic puzzle game where players are presented with a grid of tiles that conceal hidden mines. The objective is to clear the grid without triggering any mines. 
   - Players interact with the game by clicking on tiles. When a tile is clicked, it either reveals a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to that tile or it detonates a mine, resulting in a loss. 
   - The game provides visual clues to assist players in deducing where mines are located, and the goal is to uncover all non-mine tiles while avoiding the mines.

2. **User Accounts:**
   - Users will be able to log in to their accounts or create new ones.
   - The leaderboard will display player performance based on game results.

3. **Main Pages:**
   - **Index Page (index.html):** Main menu with navigation options.
   - **Help Page (help.html):** Instructions on how to play the game.
   - **Contact Page (contact.html):** Short descriptions of the authors and project contributors.
   - **Login and Sign-Up Pages:** For user authentication and account creation.
   - **Game Page (game.html):** The main interface for playing Minesweeper.
   - **Leaderboard Page (leaderboard.html):** Displays player rankings based on various metrics.

4. **Game Functionality:**
   - Responsive and well-structured HTML5 code with semantic roles.
   - External CSS3 file for styling, incorporating Fresno State branding (logo and colors).
   - Use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to structure game logic and player data.
   - The game will be presented in an HTML table or JavaScript Canvas.
   - Features include:
     - Start and restart game buttons.
     - Background music and sound effects for game interactions.
     - Options to customize game settings (number of mines, grid size, colors).

5. **Game Options:**
   - Players can select the number of mines and grid size (easy, medium, difficult).
   - Players can customize the board's appearance and game theme.

6. **Game Logic:**
   - Functions to place mines and manage user interactions.
   - Functions to determine win/loss conditions and track game time.

7. **Server-Side Development:**
   - PHP scripts to create and manage the relational database.
   - Tables to store game results and user information.
   - APIs to retrieve and display data on the client side.

8. **Database Design:**
   - A well-structured relational database that handles user accounts and game results.
   - Appropriate tables to manage users and game sessions.

## Documentation
- **README File:** Provides instructions for installation and usage of the web application.
- **Implementation Report:** Details the contributions of each team member, tasks completed weekly, and overall project development.

## Conclusion
This Minesweeper project offers an opportunity to integrate various web technologies and concepts learned in class. By focusing on both the front-end user experience and back-end data management, students will develop a comprehensive understanding of web programming and database interactions. The project encourages teamwork and creativity, allowing for customization and enhancement of classic game mechanics.
